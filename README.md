I am an applied scientist wrapped in site reliability engineer (SRE) clothing. What that means is I apply a somewhat unique data and software engineering driven approach to improving reliability in IT.

I am *not* a full stack or pure application developer. Rather as an SRE, I leverage code-off-the-shelf and software engineering to automate tasks, reduce alert/monitoring noise, create reporting and speed responsiveness to incidents. As an applied scientist in this context, I can build the infrastructure, write the (Python) code and perform data science that gives the insights to improve reliability over the longer term, be more predictive to prevent incidents, etc.
